# Fourier Transform Simulator
In the autumn term of 2019, study of Eulerâ€™s Formula and Roots of Unity broadened my understanding of complex numbers and led me to the story of the Fourier Transform. I found it fascinating how a seemingly chaotic function could be elegantly separated to reveal its constituent frequencies. I built this graphical simulator to help me better understand the transform process.
